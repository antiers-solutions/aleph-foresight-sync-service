<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img width="1436" alt="Explorer home page" src="images/home.png">

A blockchain explorer tailored for a specific blockchain network is a specialized web application that provides in-depth and real-time insight into the transactions, blocks, and data of that particular blockchain. It serves as a comprehensive window into the inner workings of the network, offering the following features:

1. **Search and Query**: Users can search for specific transactions, blocks, addresses, or transaction IDs, making it easy to track and verify transactions.

2. **Transaction Details**: Detailed information on each transaction, including sender and receiver addresses, transaction value, timestamps, and transaction status.

3. **Block Information**: Access to the latest and historical blocks, with details such as block height, timestamp, and the list of transactions within each block.

4. **Address Monitoring**: The ability to explore the transaction history of specific wallet addresses, allowing users to view balances and transaction flows.

5. **Network Statistics**: Charts and graphs illustrating network statistics, such as the number of transactions, block production rate, and network hash rate.

6. **User Interface**: A well-designed and responsive user interface for easy navigation and exploration.
